Tiler
=====

Tiler is a utility to extract tile data from a bitmap. Currently it is
aimed at Foenix computers, but it is intended to become more
configurable and support sprites as well as additional settings to
make it more flexible.

From a bitmap it can create a tile map, with tile index data, tile
definitions and extract the palette in 0rgb form.

Bitmaps can be created with GIMP, use 8-bit indexed mode and a
suitable palette. Export as `.bmp` with the palette included.

Run through `tiler`.
